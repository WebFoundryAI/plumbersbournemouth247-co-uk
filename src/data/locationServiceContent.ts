    {
      question: "What does it cost to clear a blocked drain in {location}?",
      answer: "Most standard blockages in {location} are resolved for between £80 and £150 with no call-out fee. We provide a fixed quote before starting any work, so you know exactly what you will pay. Complex blockages requiring jetting or excavation may cost more."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the most common causes of blocked drains in {location}?",
      answer: "In {location} we frequently encounter {commonProblem1} and {commonProblem2}. Properties such as {propertyTypes} can be particularly susceptible due to ageing pipework and mature vegetation."
    }

  "drain-unblocking": [
    {
      question: "How fast can you unblock a drain in {location}?",
      answer: "We aim to arrive at {location} properties {responseTime}. Once on site, most drain unblocking jobs are completed within one to two hours depending on the nature and location of the obstruction."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you charge a call-out fee for drain unblocking in {location}?",
      answer: "No. We never charge a call-out fee for drain unblocking in {location} or anywhere else across Manchester and surrounding areas. You only pay for the work carried out, and we confirm the price before we start."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I try to unblock the drain myself before calling you?",
      answer: "Simple blockages near the plughole may respond to a plunger or drain cleaner. However, if water is backing up from external drains or multiple fixtures are affected, professional equipment is needed. Attempting to rod shared drainage incorrectly can push the blockage further downstream."

  "cctv-drain-surveys": [
    {
      question: "How much does a CCTV drain survey cost in {location}?",
      answer: "A standard residential CCTV drain survey in {location} typically costs between £150 and £300 depending on property size and drainage complexity. We provide a fixed quote beforehand. Properties such as {propertyTypes} with larger drainage networks may sit towards the upper end."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a CCTV drain survey before buying a property in {location}?",
      answer: "We strongly recommend a pre-purchase drain survey for {location} properties, especially older builds. Hidden drainage defects can cost thousands to repair and are not covered by standard homebuyer surveys. A CCTV inspection gives you negotiating power and peace of mind."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a CCTV drain survey take in {location}?",
      answer: "A typical residential survey in {location} takes between one and two hours. You receive the full report with annotated footage within 24 hours. Larger properties or those with complex drainage layouts may require additional time."
    }
  ],
  "drain-jetting": [
    {
      question: "Is drain jetting safe for older pipes in {location}?",
      answer: "Yes, when carried out by qualified engineers. We adjust water pressure to suit the pipe material and condition — lower pressures for older clay pipes common in {location}, higher pressures for modern plastic systems. A brief CCTV check beforehand confirms the pipe can safely be jetted."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does drain jetting cost in {location}?",
      answer: "Drain jetting in {location} typically costs between £100 and £250 depending on the length of pipe and severity of deposits. We confirm the price before starting. Regular maintenance jetting is usually at the lower end of this range."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should drains be jetted in {location}?",
      answer: "For most {location} residential properties, jetting every 12 to 18 months keeps drainage flowing freely. Properties with mature trees nearby, or commercial kitchens producing grease, may benefit from more frequent cleaning — typically every 6 to 12 months."
    }
  ],
  "emergency-drain-services": [
    {
      question: "How quickly can you respond to a drain emergency in {location}?",
      answer: "Our emergency teams are positioned across Manchester and surrounding areas and reach {location} {responseTime}. We operate around the clock — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including bank holidays — so help is available whenever you need it."
    },
    {
      question: "What counts as a drainage emergency?",
      answer: "Situations requiring an emergency response include sewage backing up into your property, flooding from blocked or collapsed drains, overflowing manholes, and any drainage failure presenting a health risk. If in doubt, call us and we will advise whether an emergency visit is needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you charge more for emergency callouts in {location}?",
      answer: "We offer competitive fixed pricing for emergency callouts in {location} with no hidden charges. While emergency work may cost more than routine maintenance due to the urgency and equipment required, we always confirm the price before starting."
    }
  ],
  "drain-repairs": [
    {
      question: "How much do drain repairs cost in {location}?",
      answer: "Drain repair costs in {location} depend on the extent of damage and the method required. No-dig pipe relining typically ranges from £300 to £800 per section. Excavation repairs vary more widely depending on depth and access. We provide a detailed quote after CCTV diagnosis."
    },
    {
      question: "Can drains be repaired without digging in {location}?",
      answer: "In many cases, yes. No-dig pipe relining inserts a resin-coated liner into the damaged pipe, which cures to form a new pipe within the old one. This is ideal for cracks, joint displacement, and root damage in {location} properties, avoiding disruption to gardens, driveways, and landscaping."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do drain repairs take in {location}?",
      answer: "No-dig relining is typically completed in a single day. Excavation repairs may take one to three days depending on the extent of damage, pipe depth, and ground conditions in {location}. We always provide a realistic timeframe before work begins."
